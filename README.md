## How To Operate
The User have to provide the customer details and select a duration must . There are 3 number input fields which are week, day, hour in the duration section. For example if the user want to rent the car for 9 days and 3 hours the value of the week field will be 1 , day will be 2 and hour will be 3 after providing these information correctly the system will calculate the price according to the pricing details from the api for different vehicles. The discount will be applied on the overall price but not in the damage or tax. There are options to select the vehicle. For this the user must select the vehicle type first. I have indentified the unique types from the api. After selecting the vehicle type the user can select available models for that specific type.
